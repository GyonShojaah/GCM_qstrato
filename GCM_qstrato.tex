\begin{abstract}

\water is a key molecule in characterizing atmospheres of temperate terrestrial planets, and observations of transmission spectra are expected to play a primary role in detecting its signatures in the near future. 
%
Detectability of \water absorption features in transmission spectra primarily depends on the mixing ratio of \water in the upper part of the atmosphere. 
%
While the stratospheric \water mixing ratio of the Earth is as low as $10^{-6}$ due to the cold trap, the efficiency of the cold trap depends on the atmospheric properties. 
%
Here we study the 3-dimensional distributions of \water for synchronously rotating aquaplanets using the GCM, \modelE, and examine the effect of the  spectra of incident stellar radiation. 
%
We observe a gradual increase of \water mixing ratio in response to the increased incident flux, while the surface temperature around the substellar point is moderate over a wide range of instellation. 
%
At higher incident flux, we find a large-scale circulation in the upper part of the atmosphere, presumably originating from the high heating rate due to the enhanced absorption by abundant \water in the upper atmosphere. 
%
The interplay between the efficient vertical transport of \water by this large-scale circulation and the radiative heating appears to play the key role in determining the steady state of the \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere.  
%
Consistently, \water mixing ratio is found to be well correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident flux. 
%
Our results imply that various levels of \water mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere may be expected for synchronously rotating temperate terrestrial planets, and for the more highly irradiated ones the \water absorption features in the transmission spectra are strengthened by factor of a few, loosening the observational demands for a direct H$_2$O detection.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

One of the primary interests in future observations of Earth-size planets is the presence of \water. 
Knowing what kind of planets harbor it and what do not is an essential ingredient to assess the origin of planetary \water, or to constrain the evolutional pathway. 
It also serves as important prior knowledge to prioritize the targets for identifying biosignatures, on the assumption that \water is a prerequisite for life as we know it. 

Nevertheless, it has been pointed out that detecting molecular signatures on terrestrial planets is challenging \citep{Cowan2015}. 
Earth-size planets are indeed small and the atmospheres are presumably thin, making atmospheric features in transit spectra typically at the order of ppm. 
This requires a significant devotion of telescopes, even in the case where the observational noise is limited by stellar photon noise. 
\water is particularly difficult because, while \water is a dominant opacity source of Earth's atmosphere, the mixing ratio of \water above the troposphere---where the transmission spectroscopy typically probes---is fairly small due to the ``cold trap'', i.e., water vapor evaporated from the surface is transported upward, but it condenses as air rises and most of it precipitates, leaving the stratosphere fairly dry. 
Several studies of modeling transmission spectra of the Earth found  undesirebly weak signatures of \water \citep[e.g.,][]{Ehrenreich2006, Kaltenegger2009, Betremieux2013, Misra2014}. 
However, the efficiency of the cold trap depends on the atmospheric properties in general. 

The mixing ratio in the stratosphere is also closely related to planetary water loss and thus planetary habitability. 
\citet{Kasting1993} considered the maximum mixing ratio that would allow for a planet to sustain Earth-mass water over the Earth's age, $\sim 3 \times 10^{-3}$, as a criterion for the inner edge of the habitable zone (the threshold for the moist-greenhouse stage). 
Motivated mainly by this ``habitability'' aspect, atmospheric models with different levels of complexity have examined the stratospheric \water with varying planetary properties, or equivalently the efficiency of the cold trap. 

\citet{Kasting1993} and \citet{Kopparapu2013} used a simple 1D model with saturated troposphere and isothermal stratosphere to examine the response of the stratospheric \water mixing ratio to increased instellation. 
% 
\citet{Wordsworth2013} used 1D radiative-convective models with different levels of CO$_2$ and found that in some range of parameters the efficiency of the cold trap is smaller than the Earth, which could lead to a significant loss of water. 
%
\citet{Rugheimer2013} and \citet{Rugheimer2015} combined 1D radiative-convective model with photochemical model to assess the effect of spectral energy distribution of incident stellar spectra on atmospheric profiles, and observed an enhanced water mixing ratio in the stratosphere for planets around late-type stars (while not discussed in detail). 

Inevitably, 1D models rely on several assumptions that cannot be treated within the model, including the global transport of heat and water vapor as well as the effect of clouds. 
Over several years, various 3-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) revisited the atmospheric structure of terrestrial planets and have demonstrated the importance of taking account of the 3-dimensional circulation and climate heterogeneity. 

% Abe
 \citet{Abe2011} performed a series of GCM experiments using Atmospheric General Circulation Model 5.4g from the Center for Climate System Research, the University of Tokyo, and pointed out that dry planets with a limited amount of water have stable climate over a wider range of orbital distance than ocean-covered planets. 
% Leconte
\citet{Leconte2013b}, using the Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique (LMD) generic climate model, and 
% Wolf
\citet{Wolf2014, Wolf2015}, using the Community Atmosphere Model version 3 and 4 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, found that 3-dimensional models are more resistant to increased instellation and have modest surface temperature and low stratospheric water vapor over a wider range of instellation than what 1D models predict. This is primarily due to the unsaturated subsidence region of the Hadley cell, which is not taken into account in 1D models. 

The 3-dimensional climate may be drastically different for habitable-zone planets around late-type stars. 
This is not only due to the difference on the spectral energy distribution of the star but also because they may be synchronously rotating \citep{Dole1964, Kasting1993}, although this need not always occur \citep{Goldreich1966,Leconte2015}.  
%
\citet{Yang2013} pointed out that for tidally-locked planets, the strong convection around the sub-stellar point produces thick clouds which contribute to keep the surface temperature moderate for a much wider range of instellation \citep[see also][]{Yang2014,Way2015,Kopparapu2016}. 
They primarily studied the highest instellation that allows for the model to converge as the proxy for the inner edge. 
While they also presented the stratospheric water vapor, the discussion was limited. 

Motivated by these works on the stabilized climate of planets around late-type stars, we are particularly interested in the water vapor transport  into the upper atmosphere, not only because it affects the water loss rate (and thus conventional criterion for habitable conditions) but also because it limits our ability to detect \water through transmission spectroscopy. 
%
Indeed, the planets around later type stars are best suited for future transit observations for several reasons including the higher transit probability, larger signals in transmission spectra, and the abundance of late-type stars in the nearby universe. 

%The water mixing ratio in the stratosphere of a planet around late-type stars has been controversial and not been fully understood \memo{OK...?}. 
%Some of the 1D atmospheric models \citep{Rugheimer2013, Rugheimer2015} as well as 3D models \citep{Godolt2015} infer orders of magnitude larger water vapor mixing ratio in the stratosphere on planets around late-type stars with similar instellation as the Earth receives, 
%while other 3D GCM models show stratospheric mixing ratio of order of $10^{-6}$ even for planets around M-type stars. 

In order to obtain better insights into the processes that control water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmospheres where transit observations probe, we conduct series of experiments with the \modelE \ GCMfor planets which receive an amount of energy from the host star similar to the Earth's. 
\modelE \ solves for the atmospheric dynamic, thermodynamic, and radiative fields up to $0.1$ mbar ($\sim $65 km in the case of the Earth), to be able to sufficiently resolve the stratosphere. 
We particularly study the dependence of water vapor mixing ratio on the incident flux (total incident flux and the spectral type), fixing planetary parameters (radius, gravity, atmospheric composition, and atmospheric pressure). 

We also present mock transmission spectra based on GCM outputs in order to evaluate the detectability of \water signatures with future transmission spectroscopy using e.g. JWST, or next-generation ground-based telescopes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We use a 3-dimensional GCM named \modelE \ \citep{Way2017}. 
This is a generalization from the GCM called {\it ModelE2} \citep{Schmidt2014}, which has been developed for the Earth at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. 
The basic architecture of ROCKE-3D is the same as the version used by \citet{way2016}, but the radiation module has been replaced by the UK Met Office's {\it Socrates} \citep{Edwards1996} after the paper was published. 
{\it Socrates} utilizes the correlated-k method to compute radiative transfer. 
We used 29 and 9 bands for short wave and long wave, respectively. 
We paid special attention to the accuracy of the radiative transfer because radiation schemes developed for the Earth system may no longer be accurate when we change the spectral types of the star and/or \water mixing ratio becomes extreme (see the result section below). 
We check the accuracy of the radiation by comparing the radiation calculation in the GCM with higher-resolution calculations, and find a reasonable match;  see Appendix \ref{ap:radiation} for more details. 

The model was configured to have horizontal grids with 4 degree resolution in latitude and 5 degree resolution in longitude, and 40 vertical layers covering up to 0.14 mbar (corresponding to $\sim 65$ km in the case of the Earth). 
Throughout the paper, we consider synchronously rotating planets for their  relevance to the future transmission observations of close-in systems. 

Our atmosphere is 1 bar N$_2$-dominated atmosphere with 1 ppm CO$_2$, to match the assumption of \citet{Kopparapu2016}. 
We will briefly discuss the dependence on the mixing ratio of CO$_2$ in Section \ref{s:sensitivity}. 
Photochemistry is disabled in our model. 

We consider aquaplanets, i.e., planets whose surfaces are wholly covered with water for the fiducial runs for simplicity. 
We use a thermodynamic ocean with 50 m depth. 
However, in Section \ref{ss:sensitivity_ocean}, we also show the results of the runs with fully dynamic ocean, to quantify the sensitivity of the results to ocean heat transport. 
The current configuration of the model does not allow us to have a ocean pixel at the south pole. Therefore for convenience we place 1 ``land'' pixel at the south pole. We assume that this tiny fraction of land pixel does not have a significant effect on the global climate of the planet. \memo{?}


%Unlike the majority of the previous GCM works on the terrestrial planets, we calculate the full dynamics of ocean for our fiducial set of runs. 
%We assume 900 meter depth ocean except for the south pole. 
%In Section \ref{ss:sensitivity_ocean}, we also present the results with the q-flux ocean model with zero heat transport, a treatment regularly used in exoplanet GCM community, in order to quantify the sensitivity to the assumption of ocean. 

In our experiments, we mainly changed two parameters: the total incident flux normalized by the solar constant, $S_X$, and the spectral types of the star. 
For the latter, four types of stars are considered: 
Sun (G2V; 5776K), 
HD 22049 (K2V, 5084K, $0.82M_{\odot }$, $0.73R_{\odot }$), 
Kepler-186 (M1V, 3755K, $0.54M_{\odot }$, $0.52R_{\odot }$)\memo{need to ask Nancy who should be cited for Kepler-186}, and 
GJ876 (M4V, 3473K, $0.334M_{\odot }$, $0.36R_{\odot }$). 
The spectra are obtained from \citet{Segura2003}, ??, and \citet{Domagal-Goldman2014}, respectively, and shown in Figure \ref{fig:star_spectra}. 

The orbital period (= spin period) is changed according to the Kepler's 3rd law, to be consistent with the total incident flux the planet receives and the stellar mass. While the incident flux and the orbital period are changed simultaneously for the fiducial set of runs, we also isolate the effect of the orbital period in Section \ref{ss:sensitivity_Porbit}. 

Our fiducial models with varying incident spectra typically equilibrate in \memo{??}. 
After the steady state is reached, we average the 3-dimensional atmospheric profiles over 10 Earth years. 
From the averaged data, we record \water mixing ratio in the upper part of the atmosphere, $x_{H2O}$, as well as related parameters introduced below.

\subsection{Simulation of transmission spectra}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to quantify the effect of \water mixing ratio on the absorption features of \water in the transmission spectrum, 
we also simulate it based on the outputs of GCM experiments, setting the model planet in a transiting geometry. 

First, the vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, and cloud particles along the ``limb'' are obtained by linearly interpolating the profiles of the GCM grid points adjacent to the terminator. 
%(The ``limb'' corresponds to the boundary between the dayside and the nightside, in other words a great circle that passes $\pm 90^{\circ} $ longitude measured from the substellar point.)

Then, we trace the optical paths of the transmitted ray according to the profile of the refraction index, in the same way as described in \citet{vanderWerf2008}, following \citet{Misra2014}. 

After that, the spectral opacity at different points along the path is calculated considering Rayleigh scattering and the absorption by atmospheric constituents \memo{and clouds?}, but not including the effect of multiple scattering. 
To compute the absorption coefficient by atmospheric molecules, we use high-resolution line-by-line opacity tables based on HITRAN 2012 database \citep{Rothman2013}, prepared separately from the correlated-k opacity used in the GCM. 
Each line in the HITRAN 2012 database is convolved with the Voigt profile which takes account of Lorentzian pressure broadening and Doppler broadening, 
and the cross sections are computed at varying pressures and temperatures, with a constant interval of the wavenumber grids : $\Delta k = 1\,{\rm cm}^{-1}$. 
The pressure and temperature grids are $P = \{10^{-5},\, 10^{-4},\,...,\,10^3\}$ mbar and $T = \{100,\, 150,\,...,\, 400\}$ K. 
The cross section at a particular point along the optical path is obtained by interpolating the values at these lattice points. 

Let us consider a spherical coordinate $(b, \theta )$ on the spherical plane centered at the planetary center. 
Denote the spectral optical depth along the ray that exits the planetary atmosphere at $(b, \theta )$ by $\tau (\lambda; b, \theta )$, 
the fraction which is blocked along the optical path that exits the atmosphere at the altitude between $b$ and $b+db$ and at the angle between $\theta $ and $\theta + d\theta $, $f(b, \theta ) \, db \, d\theta$, is 
%%%
\begin{equation}
f(\lambda; b, \theta ) \, d\theta \, db = ( 1 - e^{-\tau (\lambda; b, \theta )} ) \, b \, db \, d\theta 
\end{equation}
%%%
Using $f(b, \theta )$, the transit depth, $\Delta F$, is found by
%%%
\begin{equation}
\pi R_{\star } ^2 \, \Delta F (\lambda) = \pi b_{\rm min}^2 + \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_{b_{\rm min}}^{b_{\rm max}} db \, f(\lambda; b, \theta )
\end{equation}
%%%
where $b_{\rm min}$ is the smallest impact parameter where the transmitted ray comes through, and $b_{\rm max}$ is the impact parameter at which planetary atmosphere may be regarded as completely transparent, which we assume $b_{\rm max} = R_{\rm p}$ + 100 km where $R_{\rm p}$ is the planetary radius. 
Transmission spectra are regularly represented by ``effective altitude'', $h_{\rm eff}$, which is given by
%%%
\begin{equation}
\Delta F(\lambda) = \frac{( R_{\rm p} + h_{\rm eff}(\lambda)  )^2}{R_{\star }^2}
\end{equation}
%%%
In Section \ref{ss:result_TransmissionSpectra}, we use both the effective altitude $h_{\rm eff}  (\lambda)$ and $\Delta F (\lambda)$ to represent the transmission spectra.

\subsection{General Trend in 3D Atmospheric Profiles}
\label{ss:result_H2Omixingratio}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before examining the dependence of the \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere, we shall show the 3-dimensional profiles of temperature and water vapor. 
This is because we need to know at which altitude the mixing ratio of the \water becomes relatively uniform, to identify what kind of \water mixing ratio can be regarded as representative of the humidity in the upper atmosphere. 

Figures \ref{fig:3Dprofile_equator_GJ876} and \ref{fig:3Dprofile_equator_Sun} exhibit the profiles of temperature and \water mixing ratio along the equator for planets around GJ876 (M4V) and around the Sun (G2V), respectively, with varying incident flux. 
In all panels, the substellar point corresponds to the longitude of $0^{\circ }$. 
In general, temperature and \water mixing ratio strongly depend on the distance from the substellar point near the surface, but are fairly uniform in the upper part of the atmosphere above 1 mbar, which is 40-50 km depending on the atmospheric temperature profiles. 
In all of the runs introduced below, the spatial variation of the \water mixing ratio above ?? mbar is within ??\% \memo{will be filled later based on dynamic ocean runs}. 
Indeed the cloud content in these layers is typically on the oder of $10^{-6} $ [kg/kg], and the residence time is \memo{describe better why it is uniform.}

Therefore, in the following, we use \water mixing ratio at \preslevel mbar as a representative of \water in the upper atmosphere.

We also observe optically thick clouds around the sub-stellar point and the resultant increase of planetary albedo as a function of total incident flux (not shown in figures), consistent with \citet{Yang2013,Yang2014}, \citet{Kopparapu2016} and \citet{Way2016}. 
This indicates the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds, having a negative feedback for the surface temperature, which is pointed out by \citet{Yang2013}. 
As shown in Figures \ref{fig:3Dprofile_equator_GJ876} and \ref{fig:3Dprofile_equator_Sun}, the maximum surface temperature does not exceed 320 K even in extreme cases in our experiments, where \water mixing ratio near the model top is as high as $10^{-3}$; we will discuss this in the subsequent sections.

In this section, we examine in more detail how \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere depends on the incident flux (the total flux plus the spectral distribution) when other parameters are fixed. 

Figure \ref{fig:xH2O_S0X} presents \water mixing ratio at \preslevel ~mbar versus the total incident flux, $S_X$. 
Overall, we find a gradual increase of \water mixing ratio as a function of the total incident flux. 
The slope is much more gradual than suggested by 1D models, in particular those  of \citet{Kasting1993} and \citet{Wordsworth2013} with small CO$_2$ mixing ratio, which typically predict a rapid transition from an Earth-like dry stratosphere to a \water-dominated atmosphere. 
Our result that \water mixing ratio more slowly responds to the incident flux is qualitatively consistent with \citet{Yang2013} who studied synchronously rotating planets around M-type and K-type stars using CAM3 with an emphasis on the stability of the climate. 
Note that we cannot directly compare with their results as the assumptions do not match perfectly; specifically, \cite{Yang2013} assumed a super-Earth with larger radius ($R=2R_{\oplus}$) and higher gravity ($g=1.4g_{\oplus}$), a N$_2$-dominated atmosphere with 400 ppm of CO$_2$, and a 60-days orbital period. 
The dependence on these other planetary parameters will be investigated in the future. 

Because these are synchronously rotating planets which form climate-stabilizing clouds around the sub-stellar point, one might think that the stabilized surface temperature would explain the gradual response of \water to the increased total incident flux. 
To see the effect of the surface temperature, we now plot the same \water mixing ratio at \preslevel mbar but as a function of surface temperature around the sub-stellar points where the most convection occurs. 
It is then clearly seen that the \water mixing ratio starts to rise at a fairly modest surface temperature and increases even more dramatically as a function of surface temperature than 1D models suggest. 
This implies two things: 1) the moderate temperature contributes to the gradual increase of \water mixing ratio as a function of incident flux, but at the same time, 2) there are other processs that are responsible for its increase. 
We will examine this in the next subsection.

At large incident flux, simultaneously with the increases of \water mixing ratio and the heating rate, a substantial vertical motion of the air develops above the convection layers \memo{increase of incident flux => heating rate}. 
This circulation could take over the role of transporting water vapor from the convection that takes place in the lower atmosphere. 


The development of the large-scale circulation can be naturally explained as follows. 
When the incident flux increases, the heating rate due to the absorption by water vapor also increases. 
The air will then react by rising and adiabatically cooling according to the continuity equation for the potential temperature $\Theta $:
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Theta }{dt} + ( {\bf v} \cdot \nabla ) \, \Theta = Q_r + Q_l, \label{eq:conserv_energy}
\end{equation}
%%%
or
%%%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Theta }{dt} + u \frac{d\Theta }{dx} + v \frac{d\Theta }{dy} + \omega \frac{d\Theta }{dp} = Q_r + Q_l. \label{eq:conserv_energy_2}
\end{equation}
%%%
where $Q_r$ and $Q_l$ are the radiative and latent heatings, $\{ u, v, \omega \}$ are the conventional velocity components toward the east ($x-$axis), north ($y-$axis), and upward ($z-$axis; $\omega \equiv  dp/dt$), respectively. 
The latent heating, $Q_l$, is negligible compared to radiative heating above the altitude to which convection penetrates, so it may be dropped. 
Likewise, around the sub-stellar point, the vertical advection may be expected to dominate over the horizontal advection since horizontal gradients are small (Figure \ref{fig:3Dprofile_equator_Sun}), thus the second and the third terms in equation (\ref{eq:conserv_energy_2}) may be dropped as an approximation. 
Then, the increase of heating rate, $Q_r$, has the effect of increasing the fourth term in the left-hand side of equation (\ref{eq:conserv_energy_2}). 
Because the upper atmosphere is stable against convection, i.e., $d \Theta / d p < 0 $, larger (positive) $Q_r$ leads to a larger absolute value (with negative sign) for $\omega $, which means the upward motion develops. 
This upward motion of the atmosphere transports water vapor from the moist lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere, lowering the vertical gradient of water vapor and increasing the moisture at altitude, further increasing the absorption by water. 
This interplay between the radiative heating and water vapor transport eventually finds the steady states where $d\Theta/dt = 0$, leaving the steady circulation in the upper atmosphere around the sub-stellar point. 

This positive feedback of \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere would make a slight difference in the initial radiation field result in order-of-magnitude increase of water vapor. 
As a result, even though the surface temperature increase with $S_x$ is modest, the upper atmosphere gains moisture.  

This picture suggests that the driving factor is the incident flux that reacts with water vapor efficiently, which is the near-infrared part of the incident flux. 
Indeed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:qOH0TLS_FNIR_xH2O_247mbar}, a good correlation is found between the \water ratio in the upper atmosphere and the near-infrared portion of the incident flux, integrated over 0.9-3 $\mu {\rm m}$ (the interval is somewhat arbitrary), insensitively to the stellar spectral types.

\subsection{Transmission Spectra}
\label{ss:result_TransmissionSpectra}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to demonstrate how the \water mixing ratio is translated into the absorption features in the transmission spectra, 
we simulated the transmission spectra for the modeled planets around one of our M-type stars, GJ876. 
Figure \ref{fig:transmission} shows the transmission spectra in the cases of $S_X=1.0$ and $1.2$, where \water mixing ratio at \preslevel is roughly $10^{-4}$ and $3\cdot 10^{-3}$. 
The vertical profiles at the sub-stellar points are shown in Figure \ref{fig:AqOH0TLS_GJ876_temp_xH2O_vz_heat}, and note that the \water mixing ratio is even higher at the medium altitude (10-30 km).

\label{fig:change_ocean}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

So far, we have presented the results using fully-dynamic ocean. 
Instead of the full treatment of the ocean, it is also possible to assume so-called ``slab ocean'' model \memo{explanation}. 
Assuming the slab ocean, the equilibration time can be much shorter; with our configurations, the models typically equilibrate in $\sim $ 30 Earth years in the model time. 
Indeed slab ocean treatment has been regularly used in the published works of 3-dimensional atmospheric modeling for exoplanets with GCM. 
Therefore, we checked whether our results are sensitive to the treatment of ocean by comparing our fiducial results shown in Section \ref{s:results} with those using ``slab'' ocean model. 

Figure \ref{fig:change_ocean} compares the \preslevel ~mbar \water mixing ratio for GJ876 as a function of total incident flux, using ``slab ocean'' model with our fiducial results. 
There is a minor difference between the two, with the maximum difference being about the factor of 5 where the models with dynamic ocean tend to have lower \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere. 
This is because \memo{I am not sure. This is just tentative. } with a dynamic ocean the heat absorbed by the surface is efficiently transported to the surrounding regions and the surface temperature at the sub-stellar point is lowered, weakening the convergence and convection there.
As the top altitude of convection is lowered, saturated \water mixing ratio becomes smaller because the atmospheric pressure is larger at lower atmosphere while the water pressure is fixed. 

Overall, however, the ``slab ocean'' approximation gives a reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate for \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Effect of Orbital Period}
\label{ss:sensitivity_Porbit}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In our fiducial set of experiments, we changed the orbital rotation period (=spin rotation period) according to the Kepler's 3rd law to be consistent with the total incident flux the planet receives. 
Therefore, strictly speaking, the change in \water mixing ratio presented above has to include both the effect of the varying incident flux and the effect of varying spin rotation period. 
In this section, we separate these effects for the scientific interest, while admitting the configurations that do not realize.

\label{fig:changeP}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Figure \ref{fig:changeP} summarizes the results of the \water mixing ratio as a function of orbital(=spin) rotation period. 
The rotation period is changed from 4 Earth days to 1 Earth year. 
We find the trend where it increases as the rotation period decreases. 
This may also be explained by the \memo{Check the 3D profiles to explain this}. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary and Discussion}
\label{s:summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have investigated the response of \water profiles of synchronously rotating planets to the change in the incident flux. 
We find a gradual (casi-exponential) increase of \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere as a function of incident flux, resulting in the several orders of magnitude variation. 
With $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ mixing ratio of \water in the upper atmosphere together with the increased heating rate, \water absorption features in the transmission spectra may be increased by 2-3 times, loosening the observational demands for detections. 
\memo{Effect of clouds!!}

Due to the stabilized surface temperature at the sub-stellar point, \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere does not increase because of the strong convective layers like 1D models suggest \memo{check Wordsworth et al. 2015}. 
Instead, the increase of the \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere is induced by the increased near-infrared portion of the incident flux, while the surface temperature is still temperate; when the heating rate is increased due to the increased near-infrared portion of the flux, the increased heating rate drives the upward motion of the air, efficiently transporting \water mixing ratio from the moist lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere, further increasing the heating rate there. 

While we used q-flux ocean model with zero ocean heat transport for simplicity, the comparable models with dynamic ocean are also performed to demonstrate that this approximation of ocean results in the minor effect in \water mixing ratio within an order of magnitude. 
\memo{explain more}
We also confirmed that the effect of the change in the orbital period has the secondary effect, resulting in an order of magnitude variation. 
\memo{explain more}

In this paper, we limit our discussion on the \water profiles to the effects of the total incident flux, spectral energy distribution (=the spectral types of the host star), and the orbital rotation period (=spin rotation period, on the assumption of the synchronous rotation). 
These parameters are among the limited number of properties that can be constrained relatively easily from the observations of exoplanets. 
In principle, however, \water distributions also depends on the geophysical parameters including the surface gravity and atmospheric pressure, as well as photochemistry that depends on detailed atmospheric composition. 
They could perhaps be constrained by the retrieval from the observed planetary spectra to give an prediction for \water mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere, but  otherwise could rather be inferred from the \water mixing ratio. 
The dependence on these planetary properties will be the scope of future study.

\section{Validation of radiation scheme used in our GCM}
\label{ap:radiation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper, we applied a GCM named ROCKE-3D to planets around the stars with different spectral types. 
In doing so, a special caution needed to be taken regarding the accuracy of the radiative transfer calculation, because the baseline model of ROCKE-3D has been developed for the Earth, and the radiative transfer calculation was optimized for solar insolation. 

In order to check the accuracy of the radiative transfer calculation used in GCM model, we compare it with the more accurate high-resolution calculation assuming the same (1-dimensional) atmospheric profile. 
The atmospheric profile to test was the one at the sub-stellar point of a planet around GJ876 with $S_X=1.2$, 
This profile was chosen because of its extremely high \water mixing ratio, which is very different from the Earth. 
Assuming that profile, we calculated short wave radiative transfer with 6 bands (used in GCM) and with 280 bands, both for the cases of solar incident flux and the incident flux of GJ876. 

\memo{David, did you sort out the issue of the water vapor continuum?}

The difference between low- and high- resolution calculation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:socrates}. 
In general, we find a reasonable accuracy of the low-resolution calculation used in GCM; the fractional difference of the upward/downward flux is 4 \% at the maximum (short-wave upward flux) and that of the heating rate is 8\% at the maximum. 

\memo{David, will you describe here better? Will we specifically discuss the concerns others may have, e.g., the weight of the k-coefficient?}
